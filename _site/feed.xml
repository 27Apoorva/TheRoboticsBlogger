Well, the infamous TurtleBots falls under the category of Turtle Robots, but that’s not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The idea of TurtleBot came from two roboticists, Tully Foote and Melonee Wise, when they were working at Willow Garage in 2010, interestingly, where the Robot Operating System (ROS) was developed. Behind every idea is a person trying to solve a problem. The problem with ROS at the time was that ROS only ran on big, fancy and expensive robots. When Melonee got her hands on Kinect and wired it with iRobot Create, that gave birth to the first generation TurtleBot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;TurtleBot was a low-cost, personal robotic kit that had a completely open source SDK and can be used to build a robot that can drive around your house, as well as research SLAM or Path Planning algorithms. The possibilities were endless. No doubt, TurtleBot became a massive hit and was being used by about 15 universities to teach undergrad and graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The second generation TurtleBots, called TurtleBot2, consists of a Yujin Kobuki base, a 2,200mAh battery pack, a Kinect sensor, an Asus 1215N laptop with a dual core processor, fast charger, charging dock, and a hardware mounting kit attaching everything together and adding future sensors. It was released in October 2012, costing $1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The goal for third generation TurtleBots, called TurtleBot3, released in May 2017 in collaboration between Open Robotics and ROBOTIS, was to dramatically reduce the size of the platform and lower the price, without having to sacrifice its functionality and quality, while at the same time offering expandability. The latest generation of TurtleBots, called TurtleBot4, comes with ROS2 pre-installed and is developed by Clearpath Robotics. It is priced at $1195 and $1899. As new models of iRobot have been released over the years, interestingly, TurtleBot4 is equipped with iRobot Create3 mobile base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The big question is why this small, affordable robot, primarily used for teaching robotics, was named with the word “turtle” in it. Well, as Melonee said in an interview, “Everything in ROS is turtles”. The TurtleBot actually came from Turtlesim and the intent behind Turtlesim was to teach ROS and ROS Packages. Turtlesim is a simulator where a turtle-like robot can be moved around and teleported to a particular location. Now, all the baby-boomers and early-millennials might find this all too familiar. Remember the Logo, an educational programming language widely known for turtle graphics? Actually, the turtlesim commands were inspired and similar to command structures as Logo Turtles. Logo was designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon, but there were no physical turtle robots at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;In the late 1940s, a researcher named William Grey Walter worked on small, mobile robots, named Elmer and Elsie. These robots used analog circuits for thinking, were three-wheeled and had the ability to go to the charging station. The robots had a strong resemblance to Tortoises (or turtles) due to their shape and slow movement. Here is a sneak peak: Grey Walter’s tortoises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;When Logo programming came, a researcher at MIT, named Marvin Minsky, took the design of a three-wheeled pen robot from Tom Callahan, and the rest was pretty much a DIY job, using a canister and a pen in the middle so that the robot could draw its path, as well as a “tail” for stability and undercarriage viewability. This robot was eventually known as a “Yellow Turtle” and was mainly used by children at school as a way of programming robots to draw or to explore an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;In 1971, Mike Peterson, who was a MIT Lab Consultant, introduced the first Logo-controlled turtle robot and is also the person credited to use the term “turtle”. This was just the beginning of the turtle robots. What followed was a series of new and better turtle robots. The very next year, turtle robots went commercial when Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN)’s Paul Wexelblat built the first wireless turtle robot named “Irving”. In 1974-76, Radia Perlman created a turtle robot that could be controlled with a “button box”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The question was how long sci-fi could have stayed away from the impact of these turtle robots. The answer was not for long, as the first Star Wars film came out in 1977 and some people say that the small black MSE-6 mouse droid was definitely influenced by turtle robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;From 1988 to 2011, Valiant Technology, a company I could find on LinkedIn, built the Valiant Turtle Robot, which could be connected to an Apple IIe computer and could be programmed in Logo. This robot was mostly used in schools for teaching coding to kids. The Valiant Turtle had a pen in the center with an up/down mechanism and could draw any pattern on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;Recently, when I talked to my 7-year old nephew, who knows I am a Roboticist, he couldn’t stop himself from talking about his Lego robotics kit. Lego isn’t as new to the game as one might think. In 1998, Papert (Logo’s founder) collaborated with Lego and the result was the Lego Mindstorms series of robotics kits priced at $199, which would be about $400 in 2023. Certainly, at some point, someone had to cross the Atlantic and so turtle robots went international. Denning International was a Boston-based turtle robots company, but was the trading name for the private Australian company, Branch &amp;amp; Associates Pty Ltd, (B&amp;amp;A) although Denning International got some bad press in its day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;The other robots launched in this period were ‘Turtle Tot Robot’ By Flexible Systems, ‘Tasman Turtle’ and ‘Terrapin Turtle’ Robot by Terrapin Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;There were also some cool advertisements in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;Even today, people are using the concept of turtle robots. Some of them are fighting in robot wars and built a turtle robot, calling them Terror Turtles, for not just one, but at least for four series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg14.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;There exists instructables, like Open Source Turtle Robot, and even Arduino-based robot turtle kits and Lego Robotics kits are still part of early STEM education.Nonetheless, robots and turtles are very much intertwined. For over 80 years, the underlying thought process for the turtle robots has been the same, an open source, free-to-build-on platform, to teach, and give access to children to learn robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px auto;&quot;&gt;As for the next generation TurtleBots, I think it is time to take them outdoors, on the sidewalks, in the urban environment. The space of indoor robotics has had massive development in the last decade and today, it is a relatively easier problem to solve. Whereas the robots for curbside, or last-mile delivery, even self-driving cars, are still facing major challenges, especially during extreme weather conditions and drastically dynamic environments with new edge cases and poor sensor readings. We are secretly waiting for the TurtleBots 5.0 to chill at the Campus Quads with its 3D Lidar and perhaps GPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Apoorva Gupta</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Post Formats" /><category term="readability" /><category term="standard" /><summary type="html">With the title of this article being “Turtle Robots”, you might be thinking to yourself, “Hmm, well I know about TurtleBots”, assuming you are into Robotics.

This revelation was not so much shocking as it was enlightening. During my time in graduate school studying Robotics Engineering, I was heavily encouraged or even pressurized to learn ROS. However, this experience showed me that not all companies and projects rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular open-source framework for robotics software development. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building, deploying, and running robots, and has become a standard in the robotics community. However, ROS is not the only option for building robotics systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will explore some alternative options for robotics development that do not rely on ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python-based frameworks: Python is a popular programming language for robotics, and there are several frameworks available for building robots without ROS. Some examples include:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PyRobot: PyRobot is a lightweight, open-source framework for building robots using Python. It provides a set of tools for controlling robots, including a robot simulator and a control library.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;RobotPy: RobotPy is a Python-based framework for building robots for the FIRST Robotics Competition. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pyControl: pyControl is a framework for building robots using Python and the Raspberry Pi. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware-specific frameworks: Some robot manufacturers provide their own frameworks for building robots without ROS. These frameworks are often specific to the manufacturer’s hardware and may not be compatible with other robots. Examples include
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lego Mindstorms EV3: The Lego Mindstorms EV3 is a popular robotics kit for building robots, and it comes with its own software for programming the robots.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Arduino: Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that can be used for building robots without ROS. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middleware frameworks: Middleware frameworks provide a layer of abstraction between the robot’s hardware and the software that controls it. These frameworks can be used to build robots without ROS. Examples include:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;YARP: The Yet Another Robot Platform (YARP) is an open-source middleware framework for building robots. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware, and it can be used with a variety of programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;OROCOS: The Open Real-time Control System (OROCOS) is an open-source middleware framework for building robots. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware, and it can be used with a variety of programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the alternative options mentioned are open source libraries. Interestingly, there still exists one more, the most basic way to build robots. With some experience in path planning, sensor fusion, control systems and some low-level firmware communication with robot’s hardware, we can create a robot that can navigate in a dynamic environment avoiding obstacles. By not using ROS, a project can have more control over the specific functionality it uses and can be tailored to the specific needs of the application. I recently heard about a company called Mujin that has succeeded worldwide without using ROS. Even though I use ROS extensively, the possibility of Robotics without ROS is not just based on theory, but rather rooted in practicality.&lt;/p&gt;

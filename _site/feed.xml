&lt;!--excerpt.start--&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;  
This blog is a written presentation of the talk I gave at ROS Meetup Delhi, India in April 2023. &lt;br /&gt;
I was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangramvision.com/&quot;&gt;Tangram Vision&lt;/a&gt;’s work on Rust for Robotics and the blogs, and talks by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bminortx/&quot;&gt;Brandon Minor, CEO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--excerpt.end--&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;So, I will start with asking a simple question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Why are Roboticists looking for a new programming language?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;As a Roboticist, my preferable coding language is C++ as this is the language that runs on the actual robots. Generally, Python-based ROS nodes suffer performance issues on hardware. Python and in some cases, Matlab are generally used for research and proof of concept purposes. &lt;br /&gt;
C++ is well suited for embedded platforms as it can get &lt;b&gt;“Close to the metal”&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
But C++ comes with its own set of problems:
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; &lt;i&gt;Portability between different platforms and operating systems&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      In a real-world scenario, my development system and deployment system would be quite different from each other as shown below.
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  
          The performance of the C++ code gets affected by the number of threads, and different operating systems, and isn’t consistent across different platforms.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slow Compile Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Based on my experience, for about 20 ROS C++ Packges, the code compile time was anywhere between 45 mins to 1 hour. Of course, you can build only one package at a time during debugging but for verification and sanity checks, you will build the entire codebase with integration tests and if the bug is still present, the compile time adds up quickly to be very painful and could easily become an overhead.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyclic Dependency&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      In ROS, Node 1 can depend on Node 2 for a .msg file. Node 2 depends on Node 3. Node 3 depends on Node 1 for a .msg file. This can lead to cyclic dependencies if the developer is not careful. 
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Manual Memory Management causes leaks and crashes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      In C++, a developer needs to figure out when and where to use the mutex to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same data.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no built-in memory safety&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Hello, Rust!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Rust is an open Source Systems Programming Language created by Mozilla Research Project.
Fun Fact: It was voted as the most loved language by StackOverflow four years in a row. It is developed with an emphasis on Safety, Speed, and Concurrency. It provides High-Level Abstraction and Low-Level control over system resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rust is based on two principles:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
But why is there a Rust buzz? It will be quite evident soon how all the problems with C++ are magically taken care of by Rust.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Portability&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Rust is a cross-platform language and performance is consistent across different operating systems.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Performance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        There is zero cost for abstraction, and move semantics, leading to potentially faster code resolving the problem of slow compile times with C++.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Painless Packaging and Dependency Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Rust provides Cargo and Xargo for package management that can prevent cyclic dependency.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Concurrency&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Rust prevents data races and deadlocks. There is no need for manual management of mutexes and locks. 
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Memory Safety &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Null pointers and dangling pointers are not allowed to prevent memory leaks.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Type Inference and Efficient C Bindings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        In short, if a function asks for degrees and you provide radians, Rust can automatically infer that type conversion is needed. And it will use the type conversion function from radians to degrees if it has been defined. How cool is that?
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
       It is very hard to write code with undefined behavior in Rust.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Community&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      The Rust User Forum, internal forum, and chat platforms are heavily active to contribute, develop, and learn Rust. For more information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/community&quot;&gt;https://www.rust-lang.org/community&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Before looking at Rust code, it is important to understand the basic Rust Terminologies.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 55%;&quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Ready to witness Rust&apos;s magic?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;In the below code, I have defined a dangling pointer. A dangling pointer is a pointer that doesn’t point to a valid object. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  
I declare a mutable raw pointer &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; as a null pointer in line 2 and I assign &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; to a new pointer &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. 
Then I free the memory allocated to &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; using the C free function. &lt;br /&gt;
This leaves q as a dangling pointer since it still points to the memory location that was just freed.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I attempt to print the value at &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, which leads to undefined behavior since the memory location it points to has been freed.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I know nobody would deliberately write such code but dangling pointers can exist under certain unknown circumstances in a fairly large codebase.
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
  
  When I try to compile the code in Rust, the compiler throws an error and will not build the code at all. This will never happen in C++ and mostly, I would have to attach the debugger and spend hours finding the crash. &lt;br /&gt;
That is how amazing is the safety provided by Rust. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;ROS and Rust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Let’s take a turn and see how ROS and Rust interact with each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Below are the Rust-based ROS packages available to begin development of Robotics code in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: auto 3rem;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 1px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  
Links are available in the Resources section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The wait is over and now I will show you an example of Rust in Robotics.&lt;br /&gt;
I have a simple multi-threading model in ROS 2 shown below. By default, the ROS 2 C++ callbacks are sequential and not parallel. In this example, I have set up two string callbacks in ROS 2 both printing the incoming string from the topic.

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
  
  Furthermore, I have added a 2 seconds wait in callback1. This causes the callback2 to be blocked by callback1 and the rate at which callback should be executed is not maintained as evidenced by the execution of the code. From the timestamp, it is seen that the code execution was; callback1 (16824198&lt;b&gt;71&lt;/b&gt;.593) -&amp;gt; wait for 2 seconds -&amp;gt; print the incoming string ‘hey’ (16824198&lt;b&gt;73&lt;/b&gt;.593) when callback2’s ‘oy’ message was blocked.

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;

  Now imagine a robot’s camera image callback is blocked by another callback and the robot is operating on an older camera image for object detection. The robot will not have the latest information about the obstacles. Robots operating on delayed and old information can lead to horrible safety-related incidents and collisions.&lt;br /&gt;
  ROS 2 does provide a solution that is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Executors.html&quot;&gt;MultiThreadedExecuter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with callback groups. But it comes with the overhead of deadlocks, manual memory management, race condition, deciding the number of threads, and scheduling execution. All of them being standard problems with C++.
  Fortunately, there is Rust to the rescue. &lt;br /&gt;
  The next code is an example of the same use case written in Rust where I have created two threads that can run each callback parallelly without blocking each other. 
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
  From the below result, it is evident from the timestamp that callback1 is published after every 2 seconds while callback2 keeps receiving messages.

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
  This example is for a very basic use case of publishing strings. Generally, I would want to extract data from the callbacks and use it elsewhere in the codebase. &lt;br /&gt;

  Now, this is where things start getting complicated as there will be a case where one thread would be updating the data while another wants to access it simultaneously. 

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article4/image11.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
  In Rust, I can create an &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; that allows multiple ownership while ensuring thread safety. Overall, in the first line of the example above, a thread-safe shared string is created that can be accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously without causing data races. In the second line, I create a clone of data1 since we need to pass it to another thread inside the callback. In this way, I can easily access the data while printing as well as inside the thread without manually managing and figuring out when to lock and unlock the mutex. 
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Here are some companies already using Rust.

          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  As for Robotics, Rust is ready to be used for UI/Frontend, Webhooks, and systems programming.&lt;br /&gt;
  While RUST is safe, efficient, and user-friendly, it is heavily under development, especially for ROS
  Also, C++ has been around for decades whereas Rust has been around only for about 10 years.
  In my opinion, Rust is very promising as witnessed in the blog but it will take time for Rust to become mainstream for Robotics.

This will never happen in C++ and mostly, I would have to attach the debugger and spend hours finding the crash. That is how amazing is the safety provided by Rust. ROS and Rust Let’s take a turn and see how ROS and Rust interact with each other. Below are the Rust-based ROS packages available to begin development of Robotics code in Rust. Links are available in the Resources section. The wait is over and now I will show you an example of Rust in Robotics. I have a simple multi-threading model in ROS 2 shown below. By default, the ROS 2 C++ callbacks are sequential and not parallel. In this example, I have set up two string callbacks in ROS 2 both printing the incoming string from the topic. Furthermore, I have added a 2 seconds wait in callback1. This causes the callback2 to be blocked by callback1 and the rate at which callback should be executed is not maintained as evidenced by the execution of the code. From the timestamp, it is seen that the code execution was; callback1 (1682419871.593) -&amp;gt; wait for 2 seconds -&amp;gt; print the incoming string ‘hey’ (1682419873.593) when callback2’s ‘oy’ message was blocked. Now imagine a robot’s camera image callback is blocked by another callback and the robot is operating on an older camera image for object detection. The robot will not have the latest information about the obstacles. Robots operating on delayed and old information can lead to horrible safety-related incidents and collisions. ROS 2 does provide a solution that is MultiThreadedExecuter with callback groups. But it comes with the overhead of deadlocks, manual memory management, race condition, deciding the number of threads, and scheduling execution. All of them being standard problems with C++. Fortunately, there is Rust to the rescue. The next code is an example of the same use case written in Rust where I have created two threads that can run each callback parallelly without blocking each other. From the below result, it is evident from the timestamp that callback1 is published after every 2 seconds while callback2 keeps receiving messages. This example is for a very basic use case of publishing strings. Generally, I would want to extract data from the callbacks and use it elsewhere in the codebase. Now, this is where things start getting complicated as there will be a case where one thread would be updating the data while another wants to access it simultaneously. In Rust, I can create an Arc that allows multiple ownership while ensuring thread safety. Overall, in the first line of the example above, a thread-safe shared string is created that can be accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously without causing data races. In the second line, I create a clone of data1 since we need to pass it to another thread inside the callback. In this way, I can easily access the data while printing as well as inside the thread without manually managing and figuring out when to lock and unlock the mutex. Here are some companies already using Rust. As for Robotics, Rust is ready to be used for UI/Frontend, Webhooks, and systems programming. While RUST is safe, efficient, and user-friendly, it is heavily under development, especially for ROS Also, C++ has been around for decades whereas Rust has been around only for about 10 years. In my opinion, Rust is very promising as witnessed in the blog but it will take time for Rust to become mainstream for Robotics.

&lt;!--excerpt.start--&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt; Congratulations on taking the first step into the fascinating realm of robotics!&lt;br /&gt; In this tutorial, I will walk you through the in-depth process to install Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 on a Windows 10/11 system using the free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads&quot;&gt;Oracle VirtualBox software&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;!--excerpt.end--&gt;


  &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Pre Requisites&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Make sure you satisfy the below prerequisites before installing Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine and ROS 2 Humble on your Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul style=&quot;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A computer running Windows 10 or 11. This guide uses Windows 10 64-bit. 
      Note: VirtualBox should work fine on any recent version of Windows 10 or 11.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu: Desktop 22.04 ISO Image&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oracle VirtualBox 7.1 software&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Minimum 50 GB of Storage memory&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Minimum of 8 GB of RAM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt; 

  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Let’s dive right into the process to set up Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual machine to start working with ROS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Download Ubuntu 22.04 ISO Image&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ol style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; This section will walk you through the process of downloading and installing the latest LTS version of the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, i.e., &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 Download Page&lt;/a&gt; and Download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/jammy-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;&gt;64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;.iso&lt;/code&gt; desktop image will start downloading. &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article2/ubuntu_install.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          padding: 10px;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  
      NOTE : Windows 10/11 systems are based on the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;AMD64/Intel-64&lt;/code&gt; architecture. Make sure you use the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/code&gt; image for a Windows 10/11 system and not an &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;ARMv8&lt;/code&gt;  image. This step might take time depending on your internet speed. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Download and Install VirtualBox&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ol style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In this section, you will use the Oracle VirtualBox software. VirtualBox is a free general-purpose virtualizer available across Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; Go to the VirtualBox Downloads page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads&quot;&gt;Oracle VM VirtualBox Downloads page&lt;/a&gt; and click on the &lt;b&gt;Windows hosts&lt;/b&gt; link to download the VirtualBox software. It will download a “.exe” installer file into your Downloads folder.

          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;  
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Locate and double-click the VirtualBox installer file from the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Downloads&lt;/code&gt; folder in your File Explorer and it will launch the VirtualBox 7.0.8 Setup wizard.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;b&gt;Next&lt;/b&gt; on the welcome screen in the Setup Wizard to begin the process.

          width: 40%;&quot; /&gt;  
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        On the &lt;b&gt;Custom Setup&lt;/b&gt; screen, you can leave the default selections for now so that the installer can set up Wizard to install the features. You can change the installation location by clicking on &lt;b&gt;Browse&lt;/b&gt; or else leave the default location. Click &lt;b&gt;Next&lt;/b&gt; when ready to continue.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        The next screen will show a Warning about the network interfaces. The Setup Wizard will install a virtual network adapter that may reset and temporarily disconnect the network connection. Click on &lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt; to process the installation.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        On the &lt;b&gt;Virtual Machine Name and Operating System&lt;/b&gt; section, fill in the name, Folder (location to store the Virtual machine files), and select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 ISO Image&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (downloaded in the previous section) in the ISO Image option. &lt;br /&gt;Click on the &lt;b&gt;Next&lt;/b&gt; button to process.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On the &lt;b&gt;Unattended Guest OS Install Setup&lt;/b&gt; section, you need to enter your &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; in addition to your machine name so that it can be configured automatically during the first boot.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Also, check the &lt;b&gt;Guest Additions&lt;/b&gt; box to install the default Guest Additions ISO that is downloaded as part of VirtualBox.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        In the next &lt;b&gt;Hardware&lt;/b&gt; section, specify how much of your host machine’s RAM and processors the virtual machine can use. Change the slider position to allocate the correct values. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; For using ROS 2 application, it is recommended to use a minimum of &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;8 GB RAM&lt;/code&gt; and at least &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;6 CPUs&lt;/code&gt;.

          margin-right: auto;
          width: 40%;&quot; /&gt;        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Next in the &lt;b&gt;Virtual Hard Disk section&lt;/b&gt;, specify the size of the hard disk for the virtual machine. For ROS 2, it is recommended around &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;50 GB&lt;/code&gt; as a minimum.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Click &lt;b&gt;Next&lt;/b&gt; to continue and view a summary of your virtual machine setting. After this click &lt;b&gt;Finish&lt;/b&gt; to initialize the machine.

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the in-depth process to install Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 on a Windows 10/11 system using the free Oracle VirtualBox software. Pre Requisites Make sure you satisfy the below prerequisites before installing Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine and ROS 2 Humble on your Windows system. A computer running Windows 10 or 11. This guide uses Windows 10 64-bit. Note: VirtualBox should work fine on any recent version of Windows 10 or 11. Ubuntu: Desktop 22.04 ISO Image Oracle VirtualBox 7.1 software Minimum 50 GB of Storage memory Minimum of 8 GB of RAM Let’s dive right into the process to set up Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual machine to start working with ROS 2. Download Ubuntu 22.04 ISO Image This section will walk you through the process of downloading and installing the latest LTS version of the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, i.e., Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish. Go to Ubuntu 22.04 Download Page and Download the 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image. A .iso desktop image will start downloading. NOTE : Windows 10/11 systems are based on the AMD64/Intel-64 architecture. Make sure you use the AMD image for a Windows 10/11 system and not an ARMv8 image. This step might take time depending on your internet speed. Download and Install VirtualBox In this section, you will use the Oracle VirtualBox software. VirtualBox is a free general-purpose virtualizer available across Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. Go to the VirtualBox Downloads page Oracle VM VirtualBox Downloads page and click on the Windows hosts link to download the VirtualBox software. It will download a “.exe” installer file into your Downloads folder. Locate and double-click the VirtualBox installer file from the Downloads folder in your File Explorer and it will launch the VirtualBox 7.0.8 Setup wizard. Click Next on the welcome screen in the Setup Wizard to begin the process. On the Custom Setup screen, you can leave the default selections for now so that the installer can set up Wizard to install the features. You can change the installation location by clicking on Browse or else leave the default location. Click Next when ready to continue. The next screen will show a Warning about the network interfaces. The Setup Wizard will install a virtual network adapter that may reset and temporarily disconnect the network connection. Click on Yes to process the installation. The next screen will ask you to confirm the installation. Click on Install to begin the installation of VirtualBox 7.0.8. The installation process will begin and it might take several minutes. Once the installation is done, click on the Finish button to exit the Setup Wizard. Launch the VirtualBox Manager from the Start Menu. Creating Virtual Machine Once the VirtualBox Software is installed properly, you can begin creating your Virtual Machine. Click the New button from the top Menu on the VirtualBox Manager window. This will open the Create Virtual Machine wizard which will let you create and configure your new Virtual Machine with the desired settings. On the Virtual Machine Name and Operating System section, fill in the name, Folder (location to store the Virtual machine files), and select the Ubuntu 22.04 ISO Image (downloaded in the previous section) in the ISO Image option. Click on the Next button to process. On the Unattended Guest OS Install Setup section, you need to enter your username and password in addition to your machine name so that it can be configured automatically during the first boot. Also, check the Guest Additions box to install the default Guest Additions ISO that is downloaded as part of VirtualBox. In the next Hardware section, specify how much of your host machine’s RAM and processors the virtual machine can use. Change the slider position to allocate the correct values. NOTE: For using ROS 2 application, it is recommended to use a minimum of 8 GB RAM and at least 6 CPUs. Next in the Virtual Hard Disk section, specify the size of the hard disk for the virtual machine. For ROS 2, it is recommended around 50 GB as a minimum. Click Next to continue and view a summary of your virtual machine setting. After this click Finish to initialize the machine. You will see a message saying Powering VM up … in the VirtualBox manager and a new desktop Window will appear for your Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual machine’s first boot. On the first boot, it will begin the unattended installation. Once the installation completes, the machine will automatically reboot to complete the installation. Finally, you will be greeted with the Ubuntu log-in screen where you can enter your username and password defined during the previous setup. Install ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill Hang in there!! You are one step away from becoming a ROS 2 developer with your Ubuntu 22.04 VirtualBox Machine setup. To install the latest LTS version of ROS 2, i.e., Humble Hawksbill, follow the steps here.

&lt;!--excerpt.start--&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Congratulations on taking the first step into the fascinating realm of robotics!&lt;br /&gt; 
  In this tutorial, I will walk you through the in-depth steps to install Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 on the Macbook M1/M2 chip using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.getutm.app/&quot;&gt; UTM Virtualization software.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--excerpt.end--&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;ROS 2 is supported in MacOS using the Homebrew installation process. Although, in my 7 years as a Roboticist, I have hardly seen anyone using MacOS for Robotics. What I have seen is the use of Virtual Desktops and Dockers with Ubuntu extensively. One of the primary reasons for configuring your development environment in this manner is because robotics software works on ARM-based development kits like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-agx-xavier/&quot;&gt;Nvidia’s Jetson AGX series&lt;/a&gt;. When utilizing Virtual Desktops on Mac M1, you effectively have the same development environment as your robot&apos;s runtime environment while keeping the M1 chip&apos;s inherent speed performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt; We now understand why and what we are doing. Let’s dive right in.
    &lt;ol style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; The first step is more of a reminder. The Macbooks with M1/M2 Chip are ARM-based platforms compared to older MacBooks and Windows which are AMD/Intel x86-based platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Different virtual desktops are available like Parallels Desktop, Oracle’s Virtual Box, and UTM each having its pros and cons. I would recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/&quot;&gt;Parallels Desktop paid version&lt;/a&gt; if you are a professional developer. For students or anyone looking for free software, I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;Virtual Box&lt;/a&gt; for Windows and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.getutm.app/&quot;&gt;UTM&lt;/a&gt; for Macbooks. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In this article, we will use free UTM virtualization software. UTM is a full-featured system emulator and virtual machine host for iOS and macOS. It is based on QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. UTM allows Ubuntu to run with OpenGL, Hardware acceleration providing a highly efficient with near-native speed performance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; I am using Macbook Pro with M1 Chip with MacOS 13. You will need about 50GB of free space for your new operating system.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mac.getutm.app/&quot;&gt;https://mac.getutm.app/&lt;/a&gt;  and click the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt; Download&lt;/code&gt; button. A UTM.dmg file will start downloading.

          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/&quot;&gt; https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/&lt;/a&gt; and Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/jammy-desktop-arm64.iso&quot;&gt;64-bit ARM (ARMv8/AArch64) desktop image&lt;/a&gt;. A &quot;.iso&quot; desktop image will start downloading. Make sure you use the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/code&gt; image for a Macbook with M1/M2 chip and not an &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/code&gt; image.
      This step might take time depending on your internet speed.
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/simg2.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 2&quot; style=&quot;display: block;

          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Double-click on the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;UTM.dmg&lt;/code&gt; file and drag the icon to the Applications folder. 
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/simg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 3&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Search for UTM and Open the UTM app from Launchpad.
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/simg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 4&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Once the app is launched, click &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Create a new Virtual Machine&lt;/code&gt;. 
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/simg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 5&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Virtualize&lt;/code&gt; option to simulate the bare metal performance.

          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; and on the next screen, you will see Boot options. Click &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;Browse&lt;/code&gt; and select the &lt;code style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;.iso&lt;/code&gt; image for Ubuntu 22.04 that you download in the above step.

            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Another important thing to learn is how to build new ros packages:
      &lt;/h3&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We need to install the `colcon` build tool.

            &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Welcome to creating your first ros workspace.
      &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
$ cd ~/ros2_ws&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Since we are doing a clone, we need git also, So install git using
            &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ sudo apt install git&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Run all the below commands from the ros2_ws folder.
              &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples src/examples -b humble&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After cloning, you should have the entire code inside your src folder for examples in ros2.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Now we will build examples of the ros package. In the root of the workspace, run
              &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ colcon build&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You should have build, install, and log folders.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You need to source before being able to launch the node. So run
              &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ . install/setup.bash&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Try a demo&lt;br /&gt;
        With the environment sourced, we can run executables built by colcon. Let’s run a subscriber node from the examples:
              &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function&lt;/code&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
        In another terminal, let’s run a publisher node (don’t forget to source the setup script):
              &lt;code style=&quot;display: block;
            width: 90%;
            min-height: 3em;
            overflow-y: auto;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            font-family: monospace;
            border: 1px solid #bbb;
            padding: 0.5em;
            white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;$ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function&lt;/code&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
        You should see messages from the publisher and subscriber with numbers incrementing.&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/simg24.png&quot; alt=&quot;article image 24&quot; style=&quot;display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Voila!! You have ROS 2 Humble Running on Ubuntu 22.04 inside a Virtual Machine on Macbook.
      &lt;/li&gt;

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the in-depth steps to install Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 on the Macbook M1/M2 chip using UTM Virtualization software. ROS 2 is supported in MacOS using the Homebrew installation process. Although, in my 7 years as a Roboticist, I have hardly seen anyone using MacOS for Robotics. What I have seen is the use of Virtual Desktops and Dockers with Ubuntu extensively. One of the primary reasons for configuring your development environment in this manner is because robotics software works on ARM-based development kits like Nvidia’s Jetson AGX series. When utilizing Virtual Desktops on Mac M1, you effectively have the same development environment as your robot&apos;s runtime environment while keeping the M1 chip&apos;s inherent speed performance. We now understand why and what we are doing. Let’s dive right in. The first step is more of a reminder. The Macbooks with M1/M2 Chip are ARM-based platforms compared to older MacBooks and Windows which are AMD/Intel x86-based platforms. Different virtual desktops are available like Parallels Desktop, Oracle’s Virtual Box, and UTM each having its pros and cons. I would recommend the Parallels Desktop paid version if you are a professional developer. For students or anyone looking for free software, I would recommend Virtual Box for Windows and UTM for Macbooks. In this article, we will use free UTM virtualization software. UTM is a full-featured system emulator and virtual machine host for iOS and macOS. It is based on QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. UTM allows Ubuntu to run with OpenGL, Hardware acceleration providing a highly efficient with near-native speed performance. I am using Macbook Pro with M1 Chip with MacOS 13. You will need about 50GB of free space for your new operating system. Go to https://mac.getutm.app/ and click the Download button. A UTM.dmg file will start downloading. Go to https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/ and Download 64-bit ARM (ARMv8/AArch64) desktop image. A &quot;.iso&quot; desktop image will start downloading. Make sure you use the ARM image for a Macbook with M1/M2 chip and not an AMD image. This step might take time depending on your internet speed. Double-click on the UTM.dmg file and drag the icon to the Applications folder. Search for UTM and Open the UTM app from Launchpad. Once the app is launched, click Create a new Virtual Machine. Use the Virtualize option to simulate the bare metal performance. Select Linux and on the next screen, you will see Boot options. Click Browse and select the .iso image for Ubuntu 22.04 that you download in the above step. Keep pressing the Continue button with default settings till you reach the summary screen. Tap on the big Play button to boot Ubuntu 22.04 Select Try to Install Ubuntu. This takes a minute and you will see a blank screen. Once you see the Ubuntu 22.04 screen, type in ubuntu to login. The system will boot with the live image. On the right side, you will see Install Ubuntu. Continue with the standard installation process. Select Install Third Party Software in the following screen. Select Erase Ubuntu and reinstall or if you are doing it for the first time, the third option Erase disk and install Ubuntu will be your first one. Choose that. Save the username and password. You will need this later for login. Continue with installation. This will take time. Once Installation is done, You will see an option to restart the screen. Close the dialog box and Power Off the system. Now using the virtual machine Navigation bar, choose Drive Image Options and eject the image file. You can restart the VM now by tapping on the Play Button. Now you will wait for 10 seconds to see the login screen of Ubuntu. Congratulations! You have Ubuntu 22.04 running on your Macbook. You can log in now using your password. How To Install ROS 2 in Ubuntu 22.04 On M1 Mac Now that we have Ubuntu 22.04 running on our Macbook with M1/M2 Chip, we can install the ROS 2 HUMBLE version by following the steps for Linux Distribution. Open Terminal. To be able to copy and paste between your Ubuntu and Mac, run the following command in your terminal $ sudo apt install spice-webdavd spice-vdagent Set locale Make sure you have a locale that supports UTF-8. $ locale # check for UTF-8 skip this step if locale is utf-8 already $ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install locales $ sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 $ sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 $ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 $ locale # verify settings Setup resources $ sudo apt install software-properties-common $ sudo add-apt-repository universe ROS 2 GPG key with apt. $ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install curl -y $ sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg Add the repository to your sources list. $ echo &quot;deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo$UBUNTU_CODENAME) main&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list &amp;gt; /dev/null Update and Upgrade your packages $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade Install Desktop Full $ sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop-full Setup environment: $ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash Add this to your bashrc script so that you don’t have to re-run the command every time you open a new terminal. $ echo “source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash” &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc To check the installation: $ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker Another important thing to learn is how to build new ros packages: Go to https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html. We need to install the `colcon` build tool. $ sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions Welcome to creating your first ros workspace. $ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src $ cd ~/ros2_ws Since we are doing a clone, we need git also, So install git using $ sudo apt install git Run all the below commands from the ros2_ws folder. $ git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples src/examples -b humble After cloning, you should have the entire code inside your src folder for examples in ros2. Now we will build examples of the ros package. In the root of the workspace, run $ colcon build You should have build, install, and log folders. You need to source before being able to launch the node. So run $ . install/setup.bash Try a demo With the environment sourced, we can run executables built by colcon. Let’s run a subscriber node from the examples: $ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function In another terminal, let’s run a publisher node (don’t forget to source the setup script): $ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function You should see messages from the publisher and subscriber with numbers incrementing. Voila!! You have ROS 2 Humble Running on Ubuntu 22.04 inside a Virtual Machine on Macbook.

&lt;!--excerpt.start--&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;With the title of this article being “Turtle Robots”, you might be thinking to yourself, “Hmm, well I know about TurtleBots”, assuming you are into Robotics. Well, the infamous TurtleBots falls under the category of Turtle Robots, but that’s not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--excerpt.end--&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The idea of TurtleBot came from two roboticists, Tully Foote and Melonee Wise, when they were working at Willow Garage in 2010, interestingly, where the Robot Operating System (ROS) was developed. Behind every idea is a person trying to solve a problem. The problem with ROS at the time was that ROS only ran on big, fancy and expensive robots. When Melonee got her hands on Kinect and wired it with iRobot Create, that gave birth to the first generation TurtleBot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;TurtleBot was a low-cost, personal robotic kit that had a completely open source SDK and can be used to build a robot that can drive around your house, as well as research SLAM or Path Planning algorithms. The possibilities were endless. No doubt, TurtleBot became a massive hit and was being used by about 15 universities to teach undergrad and graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The second generation TurtleBots, called TurtleBot2, consists of a Yujin Kobuki base, a 2,200mAh battery pack, a Kinect sensor, an Asus 1215N laptop with a dual core processor, fast charger, charging dock, and a hardware mounting kit attaching everything together and adding future sensors. It was released in October 2012, costing $1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The goal for third generation TurtleBots, called TurtleBot3, released in May 2017 in collaboration between Open Robotics and ROBOTIS, was to dramatically reduce the size of the platform and lower the price, without having to sacrifice its functionality and quality, while at the same time offering expandability. The latest generation of TurtleBots, called TurtleBot4, comes with ROS2 pre-installed and is developed by Clearpath Robotics. It is priced at $1195 and $1899. As new models of iRobot have been released over the years, interestingly, TurtleBot4 is equipped with iRobot Create3 mobile base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The big question is why this small, affordable robot, primarily used for teaching robotics, was named with the word “turtle” in it. Well, as Melonee said in an interview, “Everything in ROS is turtles”. The TurtleBot actually came from Turtlesim and the intent behind Turtlesim was to teach ROS and ROS Packages. Turtlesim is a simulator where a turtle-like robot can be moved around and teleported to a particular location. Now, all the baby-boomers and early-millennials might find this all too familiar. Remember the Logo, an educational programming language widely known for turtle graphics? Actually, the turtlesim commands were inspired and similar to command structures as Logo Turtles. Logo was designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon, but there were no physical turtle robots at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;In the late 1940s, a researcher named William Grey Walter worked on small, mobile robots, named Elmer and Elsie. These robots used analog circuits for thinking, were three-wheeled and had the ability to go to the charging station. The robots had a strong resemblance to Tortoises (or turtles) due to their shape and slow movement. Here is a sneak peak: Grey Walter’s tortoises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;When Logo programming came, a researcher at MIT, named Marvin Minsky, took the design of a three-wheeled pen robot from Tom Callahan, and the rest was pretty much a DIY job, using a canister and a pen in the middle so that the robot could draw its path, as well as a “tail” for stability and undercarriage viewability. This robot was eventually known as a “Yellow Turtle” and was mainly used by children at school as a way of programming robots to draw or to explore an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;In 1971, Mike Peterson, who was a MIT Lab Consultant, introduced the first Logo-controlled turtle robot and is also the person credited to use the term “turtle”. This was just the beginning of the turtle robots. What followed was a series of new and better turtle robots. The very next year, turtle robots went commercial when Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN)’s Paul Wexelblat built the first wireless turtle robot named “Irving”. In 1974-76, Radia Perlman created a turtle robot that could be controlled with a “button box”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg7.png&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The question was how long sci-fi could have stayed away from the impact of these turtle robots. The answer was not for long, as the first Star Wars film came out in 1977 and some people say that the small black MSE-6 mouse droid was definitely influenced by turtle robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rimg8.gif&quot; alt=&quot;turtle robot image1&quot; style=&quot;display: block;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;From 1988 to 2011, Valiant Technology, a company I could find on hrefedIn, built the Valiant Turtle Robot, which could be connected to an Apple IIe computer and could be programmed in Logo. This robot was mostly used in schools for teaching coding to kids. The Valiant Turtle had a pen in the center with an up/down mechanism and could draw any pattern on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Recently, when I talked to my 7-year old nephew, who knows I am a Roboticist, he couldn’t stop himself from talking about his Lego robotics kit. Lego isn’t as new to the game as one might think. In 1998, Papert (Logo’s founder) collaborated with Lego and the result was the Lego Mindstorms series of robotics kits priced at $199, which would be about $400 in 2023. Certainly, at some point, someone had to cross the Atlantic and so turtle robots went international. Denning International was a Boston-based turtle robots company, but was the trading name for the private Australian company, Branch &amp;amp; Associates Pty Ltd, (B&amp;amp;A) although Denning International got some bad press in its day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;The other robots launched in this period were ‘Turtle Tot Robot’ By Flexible Systems, ‘Tasman Turtle’ and ‘Terrapin Turtle’ Robot by Terrapin Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Even today, people are using the concept of turtle robots. Some of them are fighting in robot wars and built a turtle robot, calling them Terror Turtles, for not just one, but at least for four series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;As for the next generation TurtleBots, I think it is time to take them outdoors, on the sidewalks, in the urban environment. The space of indoor robotics has had massive development in the last decade and today, it is a relatively easier problem to solve. Whereas the robots for curbside, or last-mile delivery, even self-driving cars, are still facing major challenges, especially during extreme weather conditions and drastically dynamic environments with new edge cases and poor sensor readings.

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;On the first day at my first job fresh out of grad school, I was informed that “This vacuum bot doesn’t use ROS” and my mind was blown. This revelation was not so much shocking as it was enlightening. During my time in graduate school studying Robotics Engineering, I was heavily encouraged or even pressurized to learn ROS. However, this experience showed me that not all companies and projects rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular open-source framework for robotics software development. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building, deploying, and running robots, and has become a standard in the robotics community. However, ROS is not the only option for building robotics systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;In this blog post, we will explore some alternative options for robotics development that do not rely on ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Python-based frameworks: Python is a popular programming language for robotics, and there are several frameworks available for building robots without ROS. Some examples include:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PyRobot: PyRobot is a lightweight, open-source framework for building robots using Python. It provides a set of tools for controlling robots, including a robot simulator and a control library.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;RobotPy: RobotPy is a Python-based framework for building robots for the FIRST Robotics Competition. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;pyControl: pyControl is a framework for building robots using Python and the Raspberry Pi. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware-specific frameworks: Some robot manufacturers provide their own frameworks for building robots without ROS. These frameworks are often specific to the manufacturer&apos;s hardware and may not be compatible with other robots. Examples include
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lego Mindstorms EV3: The Lego Mindstorms EV3 is a popular robotics kit for building robots, and it comes with its own software for programming the robots.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Arduino: Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that can be used for building robots without ROS. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleware frameworks: Middleware frameworks provide a layer of abstraction between the robot&apos;s hardware and the software that controls it. These frameworks can be used to build robots without ROS. Examples include:
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YARP: The Yet Another Robot Platform (YARP) is an open-source middleware framework for building robots. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware, and it can be used with a variety of programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OROCOS: The Open Real-time Control System (OROCOS) is an open-source middleware framework for building robots. It provides a set of libraries for controlling motors, sensors, and other hardware, and it can be used with a variety of programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 20px 3rem;&quot;&gt;Most of the alternative options mentioned are open source libraries. Interestingly, there still exists one more, the most basic way to build robots. With some experience in path planning, sensor fusion, control systems and some low-level firmware communication with robot’s hardware, we can create a robot that can navigate in a dynamic environment avoiding obstacles. By not using ROS, a project can have more control over the specific functionality it uses and can be tailored to the specific needs of the application. I recently heard about a company called Mujin that has succeeded worldwide without using ROS. Even though I use ROS extensively, the possibility of Robotics without ROS is not just based on theory, but rather rooted in practicality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Apoorva Gupta</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Post Formats" /><category term="readability" /><category term="standard" /><summary type="html">Robotics without ROS On the first day at my first job fresh out of grad school, I was informed that “This vacuum bot doesn’t use ROS” and my mind was blown.
